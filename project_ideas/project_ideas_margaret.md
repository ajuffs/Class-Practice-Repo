## Idea 1
- My first idea was to look at the differences in Deaf English learners and hearing English speakers. I However, I cannot find a corpus for this because there is little to no research on that topic. (Especially if you focus only on the Deaf and don't lump them together with people who have learning disabilities.)
- Instead, I've decided just to look at similarities between ASL (American Sign Language) and English.
- Data: [440 English Word pairs with phonologically related and unrelated ASL equivalents](https://www.iris-database.org/iris/app/home/detail?id=york%3a932938&ref=search)
- I'm looking to see what kinds of words
- The only problem is that I have to wait to get access (if I even get it). We will see.

## Idea 2
- I'm interested in the connection people have through a mutual L2 when they don't share an L1.
- [VOICE](https://www.univie.ac.at/voice/) seems to bee a good data source to use for this.
