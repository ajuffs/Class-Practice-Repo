# Project Idea: A Comparison of Language in Chinese News and other Countries
## Summary
I think it would be interesting to compare news about events in China written by news organizations endorsed by the Chinese state vs news written by organizations within the US and other places outside of the censorship put in place by the CCP. I would like to try and write a script that would identify the type of language being used or the speech patterns (whether language is positive or negative for example) and use it to compare the news being presented from different sides.

## Data collection
I want to try and write a script that strips text from html files and sites and compiles it into nicely formatted text. Some news sites I would be looking at from China are XinHuaNet, China Daily, and Shanghai Daily. Some possibilities for comparison could be American news sites such as CNN or Fox news (This could also provide a contrast of left and right wing political views on China) and possibly Taiwanese news sites or Hong Kong news sites, as they have stronger views on China than the US does.

## Analysis
My end goal would be to try and find bias based on what kind of language and speech patterns are used depending on where the news comes from. I want to see if the Taiwanese news and Hong Kong news are more critical of China while the US has a more neutral stance and how government run Chinese news stands on its own problems. In order to discuss the type of language used, I will most likely have to compare it to another corpus.

## Presentation
I hope to present my data as a comparison of ideals and views on news based on regional influence and the influence of the respective governments. I hope that my code will be able to go through the information that I collect and comprehensively display statistics and data that is collected.
